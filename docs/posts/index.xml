      <description>Union Medico Autoinjector Adapter One of the things I have to do regularly to maintain my health is take an injeciton intramuscularly once a week.

      <description>Señor Drinknstein Comes to LIFE Señor Drinknstein started with an idea to use peristaltic pumps to serve various beverages, and has become so much more. For DEF CON 30 we worked to create a system of hardware and firmware that would give the end user a memorable experience while serving them a unique drink in a unique way at a unique event around unique people.
Because this is a finished project and I am ~lazy~ efficient, I&amp;rsquo;m going to type everything up here in most likely one go.</description>
