</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>20190814</td>
<td>&ldquo;Accessible&rdquo; badges, with tactile and other interaction methods only requiring one or two senses in which to successfully interact. This could go along with &ldquo;addons&rdquo; highlighting neural/physical sensitivities and create a more inclusive experience</td>
<td>&gt; 1000</td>
<td>Sight, Sound, Touch, Tactile, E&amp;M, Curiosity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Captive Arcade</td>
<td>20190814</td>
<td>Utilize the &ldquo;Captive Arcade&rdquo; to serve a variety of classic games to the end users. Can have a shared &ldquo;High Score&rdquo; across the board on a series of public domain classic games, with an embedded hardware/hacking challenge under the hood. Interface is the end-user&rsquo;s choice, and will be whatever works best for them. Phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, could potentially even get this working on the Nintendo Switch NATIVELY</td>
<td>100 to 400+</td>
<td>2+ senses</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line-Con</td>
<td>2017</td>
<td>Line-Con badges that use an accelerometer to track the users time standing in line, moving in line, in talks, in different villages, and even how many floors traversed in elevators. Users can view their stats on a massive leader-board of all the different kinds of line-con activities we can track with the on-board sensors</td>
<td>&gt; 1000</td>
<td>Touch, Tactile, Empathy, Mortality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Omelette</td>
<td>20190821</td>
<td>Gotta break some eggs to make an omelette right? As Dexter taught us as kids &ldquo;Omelette du Fromage&rdquo; means Cheese Omelette, we will teach the conference that &ldquo;Cracking&rdquo; some boards can be useful, especially when it helps to solve the puzzle :O</td>
<td>&gt;1000</td>
<td>Sight, Touch, Tactile, Curiosity, Mortality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Diffraction and emissions from it all</td>
<td>201908</td>
<td>Embed spectrum-tubes in the desired shapes in acrylic, excite when anode/cathodes have voltage applied, or are around a strong enough electric field. With enough research could have them standalone-fluoresce a limited # of times with on-board rechargeable power supply</td>
<td>&gt;100</td>
<td>E&amp;M, Sight, Curiosity, Mortality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Defining Electropaque</td>
<td>20190819</td>
<td>Very basic circuits, almost a &ldquo;non-electronic&rdquo; badge. 4-5 layers of electropaque material with hidden electrodes on the edge for applying voltage and revealing said layer. Users most likely will just see a flat piece of &ldquo;gorilla&rdquo; glass with fun basic art. With proper voltage applied at the right touch-points on the edge, parts of the puzzle are revealed. Uber badges can come with full unlock ring already in place</td>
<td>However many you want</td>
<td>Touch, Sight, Curiosity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Happy-Mask Salesman</td>
<td>201908</td>
<td>Actual music box, but the spring also provides torque to drive an alternator that powers the device. Would need ability to en/disengage the musical element</td>
<td>However many you want</td>
<td>Sight, Sound, Touch, Tactile, Curiosity, Mortality</td>

<h2 id="important-considerations---inclusion-">Important Considerations - Inclusion :)</h2>
<p>There are important things to consider when designing bling, especially if inclusion of all neural and physical types are to be taken in to consideration</p>
<p><strong>Primary senses to consider</strong>:</p>

<p>Sight is a standard sense on all meat-puppets, meaning it is often considered the most important; however be careful. Many meat-puppets are vision impaired and benefit from additional options for interacting with whatever bling you bring</p>
<p>Also remember to include a &ldquo;LO-BLING&rdquo; mode so our friends sensitive to flashing lights may participate from the safety of their non-blingy dwellings</p>

<p>Sound, much like sight, is a standard meat-sense that most will be familiar with. Sound can often be used as an alternative to sight if one is vision impaired, and can create a rich experience if used correctly in conjunction with the other senses.</p>

<h3 id="__touch__"><strong>Touch</strong></h3>
<p>Joining the standard ranks along with sight and sound, touch is important to consider when designing something users are going to be <em>touching</em>.  It can even be used as a primary sense in rare cases, cases in which it is often beneficial to make inclusion a priority. By bringing touch in to consideration, interaction is encouraged by just holding whatever it is that is being made</p>

<h3 id="__tactile__"><strong>Tactile</strong></h3>
<p>Tactile could be included with &ldquo;touch&rdquo;, but it is really its own sense. This sense allows users who aren&rsquo;t even looking at, listening to, or consciously interacting with the device to idly play with it while gaining a sense of doing &ldquo;something&rdquo;. Tactile really shines in the recent wave of fidget toys all hitting clearance this November in every X-Mas sale near you!!!</p>

<td>Sprockets or gears, gears or sprockets, having something you spin that spins something else is always novel. Include a flywheel to store energy, some reeds, a drum, and a spring and BAM, you have a MUSIC box</td>

<td>Bearings</td>
<td>Seriously, folks love stuff that can spin on bearings, as the bearings accomplish Touch, Tactile, AND Sound senses al in one</td>
</tr>

<td>While these can be switches, these can be cosmetic too. The use of sliders allows the concealing of different easter eggs, or just gives a neat toy to play with</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spinners</td>
<td>IT SPINS!!!! Any kind of spinning is a fun addition to something meant to be idly played with over time. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a dedicated spinning function, the device should have it&rsquo;s center of gravity balanced such that it can be spun on corners easily while in line-con</td>

<h3 id="__smell__"><strong>Smell</strong></h3>
<p>Commonly a non-standard sense due to the signal-to-noise ratio in the con-air (easily remedied by $4 &amp; walk to the corner drug-store), smell is an overlooked sense in the arena of bling design. Who wants to be the <em>smelly</em> kid really? A novel implementation of Smell in a design will definitely yield novel results</p>
<table>

<h3 id="__taste__"><strong>Taste</strong></h3>
<p>Not often found in bling, taste is a non-standard sense but that does NOT make it a less important sense at ALL. Usually combined with Smell, taste can offer a powerful tool for providing clues, functionality, and even on occasion - group interaction <em>gasp</em></p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>In/Edible</td>
<td>Implementing a taste sense doesn&rsquo;t always mean a need to ingest something. It can manifest in using a meat-tool to check if voltage is applied, to check if salinity is <em>just</em> for continuity, or even just identify the geologic makeup of something</td>

<h3 id="__emradiation-invisible-spectrum__"><strong>E&amp;M/Radiation (invisible spectrum)</strong></h3>
<p>UV, IR, and the spectrum in-between is included above with Vision, and may be moved down here, for now that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re documented</p>
<p>E&amp;M/Radiation is almost always an electro-sense, being implemented in the form of sending electronic signals to change the state of integrated devices such as LEDs, screens, microphones, and more. What we mean here is the NON electronic ways to use E&amp;M/Radiation as a unique part of whatever is being created. This passively supplements the meat-senses and allows users a richer experience when iteracting with whatever is being made</p>

<tr>
<td>Fluorescence</td>
<td>Exciting noble gases in a vacuum tube, or other materials embedded in solids for a unique look. These spectra can be made unique and fluoresce different colors based on λ of UV, and could even be lit by tesla coils (non-sparking) placed throughout the conference center</td>
</tr>

<td>UV</td>
<td>Go outside to change color even when not fluorescing! Could reveal different parts of a puzzle, could potentially even enable different circuit paths due to temporary widening of the circuit</td>

<td>Temperature changes can be detected in the IR spectra, using meta materials one could create all sorts of fun with temperature variations. Could even embed pictures in the IR by using same printing methods as the 2d magnets, requiring users to change the temperature of their devices to see whatever is hidden</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2d Printed Magnets</td>
<td>Magnets printed in very specific patterns of lines such that they will only lock in place when oriented correctly over the opposite printed side. This has all SORTS of applications in the world of puzzle solving and physical interaction throughout the con. Magnetic paper could even be included in the kit, and different versions of the badge can all align on common magnetic patterns which when aligned unlock stuff on the thing</td>

<h3 id="empathy">Empathy</h3>
<p>While not really thought of as a primary sense, Empathy is one of the most important parts of putting together a project that intends to create a community. Building a device that encourages the one rule of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a jerk&rdquo; will help bolster the confidence of users and help them discover what they cannot on their own. Mainly, we want to see different behavior around familiar and unfamiliar groups of badges</p>

<h3 id="__curiosity__"><strong>Curiosity</strong></h3>
<p>As humans and inhuman alike explore the universe around us, there must be a drive to keep us going. Something to surprise us when we are least expecting it, and occasionally in a way that impacts us for life. Curiosity keeps us moving forward, opening new doors, and trying new things. It also will keep watch on Mars for it&rsquo;s remaining days #roverlove</p>

<h3 id="mortality">Mortality</h3>
<p>Much like the Event-Horizon, the devices we design need to survive going through hell and back and should also have some way to track the passage of time through a known decay process.
