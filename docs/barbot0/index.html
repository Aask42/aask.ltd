<p>Senor Drinknstein started with an idea to use peristaltic pumps to serve various beverages, and has become so much more. For DEF CON 30 we worked to create a system of hardware and firmware that would give the end user a memorable experience while serving them a unique drink in a unique way at a unique event around unique people.</p>
<p>Because this is a finished project and I am ~lazy~ efficient, I&rsquo;m going to type everything up here in most likely one go. GLHF, watch me for the changes and try to keep up.</p>
<p>So it all started in the Winter of 2021 when one of my friends said &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve got this idea for a robot that serves drinks, it uses peristaltic pumps to move things around in a sanitary fashion&rdquo;. Full stop. Verbatim, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s how it went. Anyways, next thing we know we&rsquo;re testing flow rates with pumps and trying to figure out how we&rsquo;re going to bring this thing to life. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know what a peristaltic pump is, it&rsquo;s the same kind of pump used in medical facilities to move bodily fluids around.</p>

<p>As you can see above, we can use a silicone tube (our chosen food-grade material) to transport liquids from one location to another without ever touching the liquid. You can see how this would be helpful when moving around sticky things like juices and mixers, and even <em>gasp</em> alcoholic liquids! From this proof of concept, we had an idea of where to start.</p>

Figure 12. Semi-final print of &ldquo;circuit board&rdquo; using melt-in-place pegs to seal parts down. This would come to be an issue as we needed to remove the parts at some point and you cannot do that without being desctuctive with this methodology.</p>

Figure 16. Wiring up the ratsnest of cabling! This is where our 3.3v relay cables start to show issues with randomly triggering the GPIO on their modules due to a grounding issue between the pins and the pi&rsquo;s ground. Not sure exactly what the issue was but will dive more in to that later. Fully wired up the 3.3V and 5V adjustible-voltage-limiters along with a 3.3v rail for powering all the relays. The 5v voltage-limiter is there to power the pi through VSYS</p>
