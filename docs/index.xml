      <description>Step 1. whoami? I&amp;rsquo;m Aask! Up to all the things that are fun and interesting. I created this website out of frustration of hackaday.io not being flexible enough. So I thought, instead of figuring out how to better use their services, why not learn an entire new technology stack called Hugo!
Now I&amp;rsquo;m here, updating this about me page, and have everything hooked up through gitpages.
NOTE: THIS IS NOT MY RESUME.</description>

      <description>Union Medico Autoinjector Adapter One of the things I have to do regularly to maintain my health is take an injeciton intramuscularly once a week. While many are okay just doing this free hand, and others go in to their doctor&amp;rsquo;s offices to get it done, I picked up a Union Medico autoinjector. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty cool, it holds a standard syringe and drops it in to the muscle at the same pressure every time.</description>

      <description>Señor Drinknstein Comes to LIFE Señor Drinknstein started with an idea to use peristaltic pumps to serve various beverages, and has become so much more. For DEF CON 30 we worked to create a system of hardware and firmware that would give the end user a memorable experience while serving them a unique drink in a unique way at a unique event around unique people.
Because this is a finished project and I am ~lazy~ efficient, I&amp;rsquo;m going to type everything up here in most likely one go.</description>
