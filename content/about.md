## Step 1. whoami?

I'm Aask! Up to all the things that are fun and interesting. I created this website out of frustration of hackaday.io not being flexible enough. So I thought, instead of figuring out how to better use their services, why not learn an entire new technology stack called Hugo!

Now I'm here, writing up this about me page, and eventually will get it hooked up through gitpages. Hopefully tonight and I'll be able to delete this line. 

I'll add more about my backstory once I have more of this site completed. Thanks for stopping by!
