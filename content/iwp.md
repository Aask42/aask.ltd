Welcome to the writeup for the Infinite Wifi Portals by Aask Labs at DEF CON 32! The journey to getting these mirrors designed, manufactured, coded, and out the door was a BLUR and this is meant to be a place to keep track of that.  

If you just want the repository, here ya go! There are some recent updates that improve performance!

Come back soon to check for updates to the build process and new updates to the badge to come for SuperCon 2024 in Pasadena California.
