## What's a bar robot without code?

In this writeup we will be exploring the world of how we coded Se√±or Drinknstein using a Raspberry Pi Pico, and some mosfets! We will discuss why we chose the bill of materials we did, and some of the challenges we faced with said BOM. If you see any code in here that you would like to use for yourself feel free to take advantage of the free code! We even have the full repo for this version of the bot up on <a href="https://github.com/dcshenanigans/SenorDrinknstein>github</a>
