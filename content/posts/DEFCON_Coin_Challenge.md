Welcome to the DEF CON Maker's Community DEF CON Coin Challenge, where the programs are made up, and the filament doesn't matter. I'm your host BadAask Questions and I'm here to teach you about what adventure awaits inside the walls of this twice-only experience in 2024 at DEF CON 32 in the LVCC. In this workshop we will be exploring using CODE to write, yes you read that right, WRITE, your 3d models. It will include some artwork, some creativity, and most importantly of all: Some code! If you are used to using a GUI driven 3d modeling IDE and you want to learn OpenSCAD, this is the course for you. If you know OnShape and insist on using it in our class, this is NOT the class for you. 

Now what is the outline of our course? It is an hour long adventure into the madness of OpenSCAD!

In the first 15 minutes of this course you will learn how to use your hands to draw and digitize your artwork in to Inkscape. Then you will learn how to convert it into a format that is compatible with the OpenSCAD template that will be provided as part of this workshop.
