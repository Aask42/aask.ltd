# Preface

I made this list a long while back and recently I've been asked again to share! So have fun! This is a place to type up the structured ideas I have for making "badges" and other electronic bling for conferences around the world. 

## General Bling Ideas

Title | Idea Date | Description | Audience Size | Type  
-|-|-|-|-
Accessible | 20190814 | "Accessible" badges, with tactile and other interaction methods only requiring one or two senses in which to successfully interact. This could go along with "addons" highlighting neural/physical sensitivities and create a more inclusive experience | > 1000 | Sight, Sound, Touch, Tactile, E&M, Curiosity
Captive Arcade | 20190814 | Utilize the "Captive Arcade" to serve a variety of classic games to the end users. Can have a shared "High Score" across the board on a series of public domain classic games, with an embedded hardware/hacking challenge under the hood. Interface is the end-user's choice, and will be whatever works best for them. Phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, could potentially even get this working on the Nintendo Switch NATIVELY | 100 to 400+ | 2+ senses
Line-Con | 2017 | Line-Con badges that use an accelerometer to track the users time standing in line, moving in line, in talks, in different villages, and even how many floors traversed in elevators. Users can view their stats on a massive leader-board of all the different kinds of line-con activities we can track with the on-board sensors | > 1000 | Touch, Tactile, Empathy, Mortality
Omelette | 20190821 | Gotta break some eggs to make an omelette right? As Dexter taught us as kids "Omelette du Fromage" means Cheese Omelette, we will teach the conference that "Cracking" some boards can be useful, especially when it helps to solve the puzzle :O | >1000 | Sight, Touch, Tactile, Curiosity, Mortality
Diffraction and emissions from it all | 201908 | Embed spectrum-tubes in the desired shapes in acrylic, excite when anode/cathodes have voltage applied, or are around a strong enough electric field. With enough research could have them standalone-fluoresce a limited # of times with on-board rechargeable power supply | >100 | E&M, Sight, Curiosity, Mortality
Defining Electropaque | 20190819 | Very basic circuits, almost a "non-electronic" badge. 4-5 layers of electropaque material with hidden electrodes on the edge for applying voltage and revealing said layer. Users most likely will just see a flat piece of "gorilla" glass with fun basic art. With proper voltage applied at the right touch-points on the edge, parts of the puzzle are revealed. Uber badges can come with full unlock ring already in place | However many you want | Touch, Sight, Curiosity
Happy-Mask Salesman | 201908 | Actual music box, but the spring also provides torque to drive an alternator that powers the device. Would need ability to en/disengage the musical element | However many you want | Sight, Sound, Touch, Tactile, Curiosity, Mortality

## Important Considerations - Inclusion :)

There are important things to consider when designing bling, especially if inclusion of all neural and physical types are to be taken in to consideration  

__Primary senses to consider__:  

```txt
    Sight (visual spectrum)  
    Sound  
    Touch  
    Tactile  
    Smell  
    Taste  
    E&M/Radiation (invisible spectrum)  
    Empathy  
    Curiosity  
    Mortality  
```

### __Sight (visual spectrum)__

Sight is a standard sense on all meat-puppets, meaning it is often considered the most important; however be careful. Many meat-puppets are vision impaired and benefit from additional options for interacting with whatever bling you bring  

Also remember to include a "LO-BLING" mode so or friends sensitive to flashing lights may participate from the safety of their non-blingy dwellings  

Interface | Description  
-|-
LEDs | Lots of RGB LEDs available these days, especially in the micro-pixel RGB LED wavelengths
Fluorescent Acrylic + UV | Fluoresce acrylics with UV LEDs for a unique look without all the need of EL panels, or just make EL panels, but this stuff will change color in the SUN/heavy UV to reveal a puzzle or other fun easter egg
Fluorescent gasses | Could have a tesla coil that when near, your badge glows the color of the gas inside, can include "Diffraction Gratings" with each badge, so users can dissect the spectrum of the light to solve a puzzle. 
Electropaque Film | Film that changes opacity depending on how much current is applied to either side
TX/RX over IR | Electro-sense which requires hardware to interact, allows for communication in the "infrared" spectrum. This is near enough to our visual spectrum to be included here right?
Electro-Senses | Diodes can read incoming light too, didn't you know? The robots are watching you sleep

### __Sound__  

Sound, much like sight, is a standard meat-sense that most will be familiar with. Sound can often be used as an alternative to sight if one is vision impaired, and can create a rich experience if used correctly in conjunction with the other senses.  

Type | Description
-|-
Dynamic | Wide/narrow range of pitches generated by whatever sound is produced
Clicky | Mechanical keys, toggles, switches, sliders, magnets, and other fidget type toys
Creaky | Scratching/reed like sound generation methods
Squeaky | Rubber balloons rubbing together. Not quite creaking, more high pitched and elastic sounding
Grindy | Sound of a mill running, or like a steel bumper being drug along on the ground
Windy | Not "Windy" like Chicago, "Windy" like San Francisco....Sounds like something spinning up/down like a HDD platter drive 
Geary | Gears + flywheel = geary sound
Liquidy | Splashing, squishing, and other organic meat sounds
Electro-Senses | The robots can hear you showering

### __Touch__  

Joining the standard ranks along with sight and sound, touch is important to consider when designing something users are going to be *touching*.  It can even be used as a primary sense in rare cases, cases in which it is often beneficial to make inclusion a priority. By bringing touch in to consideration, interaction is encouraged by just holding whatever it is that is being made

Type | Description
-|-
Texture | Smooth, rough, soft, etc. Can often be supplemental to artwork or other things embedded in the device
Pressure | Could be a pressure sensor, could be dynamic keys that appear due to electrical pressure being put on the screen. Where is my built in physical keyboard eh?!
Temperature | Different ways to create temperature differentials. Could take advantage of 2 layer meta-materials for all sorts of shenanigans, charging your badge with a cup of coffee being one of them
Safety | Whatever is being made shouldn't hurt the end user, meaning NO SHARP EDGES, and try to obscure anything that can snag or become otherwise caught in hair/other badges
Durability | Should be able to take a hit. These things are going to go through hell and back, much like the "Event Horizon", and must come back in one piece
Electro-Senses | The robots can *feel* you on Monday morning not wanting to go to work

### __Tactile__

Tactile could be included with "touch", but it is really its own sense. This sense allows users who aren't even looking at, listening to, or consciously interacting with the device to idly play with it while gaining a sense of doing "something". Tactile really shines in the recent wave of fidget toys all hitting clearance this November in every X-Mas sale near you!!!

Type | Description  
-|-
Switches | These are switches flush with their housing, and do not really protrude from the bezel. Could also include mechanical keyboard switches, rocker switches, and slider switches
Toggles | Like switches, except lever arm extends beyond bezel. Think marine toggle, light switch (technically a toggle), spring loaded toggles, etc...
Gears | Sprockets or gears, gears or sprockets, having something you spin that spins something else is always novel. Include a flywheel to store energy, some reeds, a drum, and a spring and BAM, you have a MUSIC box
Bearings | Seriously, folks love stuff that can spin on bearings, as the bearings accomplish Touch, Tactile, AND Sound senses al in one
Sliders | While these can be switches, these can be cosmetic too. The use of sliders allows the concealing of different easter eggs, or just gives a neat toy to play with 
Spinners | IT SPINS!!!! Any kind of spinning is a fun addition to something meant to be idly played with over time. Even if it doesn't have a dedicated spinning function, the device should have it's center of gravity balanced such that it can be spun on corners easily while in line-con
Joysticks | A recent inclusion in the tactile-arena, the joystick has become a standard fidget toy regardless of application
Electro-Senses | The robots like it when you touch them like that :O

### __Smell__  

Commonly a non-standard sense due to the signal-to-noise ratio in the con-air (easily remedied by $4 & walk to the corner drug-store), smell is an overlooked sense in the arena of bling design. Who wants to be the *smelly* kid really? A novel implementation of Smell in a design will definitely yield novel results

Type | Description 
-|-
Active | Only smelly when acted upon IE: Scratch and Sniff
Passive | Always releasing smell producing material IE: That rose flavored gum from Uwajimai
Internal | Smell is built in on-board, Magic Smoke doesn't count. 
External | Device leads users to smell
Electro-sense | That's right. The robots can smell your meat-puppet. And they don't have any opinions other than it's a "smell"

### __Taste__  

Not often found in bling, taste is a non-standard sense but that does NOT make it a less important sense at ALL. Usually combined with Smell, taste can offer a powerful tool for providing clues, functionality, and even on occasion - group interaction *gasp*

Type | Description
-|-
Internal | Integrated as part of the device, no idea how this would be accomplished but many riches to the one who succeeds!
External | Part of the journey, users seek out tastes that may be included with the device/kit, or could be available at different areas around the conference/world to offer clues and group interaction opportunities
In/Edible | Implementing a taste sense doesn't always mean a need to ingest something. It can manifest in using a meat-tool to check if voltage is applied, to check if salinity is *just* for continuity, or even just identify the geologic makeup of something
Electro-sense | Electric-sheep LOVE to dream of pancakes with REAL maple syrup, none of that high-fructose candy-corn

### __E&M/Radiation (invisible spectrum)__

UV, IR, and the spectrum in-between is included above with Vision, and may be moved down here, for now that's where they're documented

E&M/Radiation is almost always an electro-sense, being implemented in the form of sending electronic signals to change the state of integrated devices such as LEDs, screens, microphones, and more. What we mean here is the NON electronic ways to use E&M/Radiation as a unique part of whatever is being created. This passively supplements the meat-senses and allows users a richer experience when iteracting with whatever is being made

Type | Description 
-|-
Static Fields | Feel your hair lift with a balloon just rubbed on a fuzzy friend, shock your car door in the dry air, and put noise on your lines. Static fields are a fun toy that can be used to create all sorts of interesting mayhem
Fluorescence | Exciting noble gases in a vacuum tube, or other materials embedded in solids for a unique look. These spectra can be made unique and fluoresce different colors based on λ of UV, and could even be lit by tesla coils (non-sparking) placed throughout the conference center
UV | Go outside to change color even when not fluorescing! Could reveal different parts of a puzzle, could potentially even enable different circuit paths due to temporary widening of the circuit
IR | Temperature changes can be detected in the IR spectra, using meta materials one could create all sorts of fun with temperature variations. Could even embed pictures in the IR by using same printing methods as the 2d magnets, requiring users to change the temperature of their devices to see whatever is hidden
2d Printed Magnets | Magnets printed in very specific patterns of lines such that they will only lock in place when oriented correctly over the opposite printed side. This has all SORTS of applications in the world of puzzle solving and physical interaction throughout the con. Magnetic paper could even be included in the kit, and different versions of the badge can all align on common magnetic patterns which when aligned unlock stuff on the thing
Electro-Sense | This is a standard electro-sense...yes the robots can feel your WiFi and lick your bluetooth while you're sleeping

### Empathy  

While not really thought of as a primary sense, Empathy is one of the most important parts of putting together a project that intends to create a community. Building a device that encourages the one rule of "Don't be a jerk" will help bolster the confidence of users and help them discover what they cannot on their own. Mainly, we want to see different behavior around familiar and unfamiliar groups of badges

Type | Description 
-|-
Common Pairs | Behave differently alone, in pods which are "common" or "known", in new groups... Could use digress of separation to show different badge states
Experience Driven | Behave differently based on what areas of the con/experiences the user has had with their badge in tow
Electro-sense | The robots can comfort you in your times of need, there there

### __Curiosity__  

As humans and inhuman alike explore the universe around us, there must be a drive to keep us going. Something to surprise us when we are least expecting it, and occasionally in a way that impacts us for life. Curiosity keeps us moving forward, opening new doors, and trying new things. It also will keep watch on Mars for it's remaining days #roverlove

Type | Description 
-|-
Hidden things | Things we intend the user to find and feel a sense of unexpected surprise
Obvious things | Things we intend the user to always see and enjoy
Hidden things that are obvious | Little puzzles that are "Easy Wins"
Obvious things that fake being hidden | Everyone loves a red herring right?
Electro-sense | Why they need the meat-puppets around in the first place?

### Mortality  

Much like the Event-Horizon, the devices we design need to survive going through hell and back and should also have some way to track the passage of time through a known decay process. Building in a sense of Mortality encourages participation in whatever way is required to maintain the "least viable method" to maintain the status of "alive"

Type | Description
-|-
Basic mortality | Dies in water or other harsh environments
Rugged mortality | Can take a hit from a gorilla
No mortality | Breaks when you open it
Required mortality | Must break one function permanently to use another function reversible or not, it must break
Electro-mortality | Breaks when it experiences electrical based senses that overwhelm it, like an electro-bunny!
